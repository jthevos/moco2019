### Retrieving Human Traits from Signing Avatar Motion: The Problem of Gestural Identity
The aim here is to develop a virtual signer for sign language. They use
French sign language, but the idea is can be abstracted.
It is hard to virtualize these signers because so much communication is embedded
in more subtle human motions.

Naturality of motion is lacking here. Addressing this is the core of the PhD.

MoCap is central here. It must provide comprehensible information.
Identity is also a problem of SL already. There is a social demand for anonymity.

*Extracting identity* from SL gestures is the goal.

PL Stimuli = Point Light Stimuli
PCA = principal competent analysis

#### Hypothesis:
- Signers can identify themselves with just PL.
- Participants can identify known signers.
- The higher the familiarity, the higher the score.

Natural Motion -> Gestural Anonymity -> Extracting the motion queues for
gestural identity -> future work: synthesis?

#### Questions:
Can this be regionalized?

### Tracing from Sound to Movement with Mixture Density Recurrent Neural Networks

Sound tracing = rendering of the perceptual properties of sound. Short sounds. 2-4 seconds in length. Participants were asked to trace the sound with a reflective rod.

People  will approach this task in different ways. *Very* different ways.

I'll be honest. I'm not sure what the goal here is. Input sound, output dance?

#### Questions:
Was the sound spatialized?
3d graphs were a .npy file extension. What is this?

### Towards AI-Enhanced Ballet Learning
[Author](https://milkatrajkova.wordpress.com/)
Centers around "augmented feedback". Ballet is a complex motor task. Augmented feedback
is ideal in this space.
The dance learning environment hasn't changed much. You have a barre, special floor, and a mirror.
The mirror is good feedback, but it is not augmented feedback.
This feedback is also not standardized & is authoritarian/ subjective in terms of evaluation.

Judgement of any complex motor task is going to be subjective.

OutsideMe = augmented reality and uses a kinect (maybe?).

Specific avoidance of numbers to not reduce everything to a quantitative measure.

She wants to create a knowledge-base for ballet knowledge.

#### Questions:
In the same way that a pianist can have perfect technique but no feel, do you see this happening with dance as well?
In terms of capturing a knowledge base, how would pedagogic clashes be resolved?

She aims to take sonification into account.

## More Artsy Talks

### The Fatness One
Still no idea what he's talking about.

VR/AR? In an expression of.... what? Fatness?

Using the Unity Engine.

Geopolitical Zone of the Cloud? Is the cloud Geopolitical? Can that be assumed?

Everything is information. Yes, but what is he doing with this? Rupturing curves?
Seems like a VR thing but I can't really tell.

Wtf am I looking at. Sound sort of similar to "The Books" in timbre. How this relates, I dont know.

### Kinesthetic Creativity
Creativity is a Kinesthetic process. You create by *doing*.
"socio-algorithmic" "creating a world from within the world you are existing in"

There's a give and take here. Can the environment be curious about you? Interesting question.
Imagination versus knowledge. Which is more important? If Something can be imagined, can it be created?
Are there limitations?

Gestural painting. Using turbulence to create a chromatic effect in VR. Are these permanent?

On-body haptics are critical in this space.

Web-native? Need docker?

Aritifical-nature, does the environment learn you or do you learn it? Gestural sound?
Physical input as sound to produce a 3D soundscape?

Remove the keyboard for coding? Interesting idea.

### eco-somatic, performance, worldmaking
[Timothy Wood](http://fishuyo.com/). University of California Santa Barbara

More body presence in computing and music making. Bringing body awareness into practice.

Can technology reflect natural beauty?

How are we taught to care about the world? His work addresses this.

The problem is the separation between whole -> part: Body -> Mind; Nature -> Technology

Self organizing systems? Do they do the world creation? The world can be alive. And is alive. There is a give and take between you and the world.

What is authentic movement? Is there such a thing as inauthentic movement?

Modulation of poetry via your body? I guess this is more of an art installation? But there are other sounds?

Not gonna lie, not sure I get it.


## Keynote
### Intertwining Aesthetics, Ethics, and Movement
Kristina Höök Swedish af.

Soma Design. Peopel are too cerebral and forget about their bodies. Soma is thinking that
in order to get to the next level of design, we need to use the mind and body in tandem.

Orchni islands. They went to a tomb that was 5000 years old. Tools, etc.

"Sometimes shitty technology also spreads" - Höök

Worked with Ikea to make some really cool stuff.

Feldenkrais - movement practices as related to health.

Breathing Lamp is *really* cool.
Soma Mat is *REALLY* cool.
The sonic mat is fascinating. I want to learn more about this.

Somaesthetics!
The highest art of all is the art of living a better life.

embodiment: "is a lexical bandaid covering a 350 year old wound generated and kept suppurating by a schizoid metaphysics"

replace embodiment with soma.

Soma Design Manifesto
1. We design for living better lives - not for dying.
2. We design to move the passions in others and ourselves.
3. We are movement, through and through.
4. We design with ourselves - through empathy and compassion.
5. We design slowly.
6. We cultivate our aesthetic appreciation.
7. We disrupt the habitual and engage with the familiar.

Aristotle > Plato in her view. This is our one life. Who gives a shit about what else. Be here.
- ethical lives require good habits.

Sensory misalignment is also Soma design. It doesn't need to be all happy all the time.

"Not holding you balance, but *being* in balance."

Ethics portion - how can you make ethics actionable? Ethics as happiness?

Designers leave behind a set of "sedimented movements" embedded in the particulars of the system.
**The tools we have shape us.**

Self-cultivation, care and self-knowledge
Care and empathy towards others
Richer plethora of choice and expression

Drones on the opera stage!? Yes.

Joseph la Delfa - a drone you do tai chi with.

Ethics are dynamic. They are by nature interactive.

As designers... we need to engage.

Does the micro soma scale? Should we even be putting more "stuff" into the world?
Well... let' just put *better* stuff into the world.

There is a book on Soma Design - MIT Press

#### Some takeaways:
This field is *clearly* very new. Tim's talk is exemplary of this. People are still figuring out how this all relates. *Especially* in the second half. The more sciency stuff was way more clear.
Much of this is very philosophical.
Much of this is very circle-jerky.
Much of this is very scattered.

I'm not sure there is a way to evaluate the merit of research yet. It seems to be a free for all.

All that said, this keynote kicked ass.

## Day 2
### Performance, Art, and Cyber-Interoceptive Systems (PACIS)
Batdorf technique.
The idea here is that you use bioinformatic signals to capture the data and record the state of being.

Can these signals and inferences from computation make for better performances?

A band around the ribs alone does not capture breathing data - only rib movement.
Thus a new system was developed.

"I am a broken bird with heavy wings" - lul

### Using Training Technology Probes in Bodystorming for Physical Training
fairly low tech but used for "bodystorming"


### Caligraphy Performance with Sound
execution of physical movement and realization of intention is similar with both musicians and calligraphers.
Calligraphy strokes can be mapped to musical gestures.

Technical - sound file envelope.

#### Questions
How were scales chosen or restricted?

Can thickness of the brush correspond to deeper tones? I.e., string diameter = lower note?
Can this be done live? jython? osc?


#### Max + Ableton.
max and ableton are bad at multithreading. instead, use separate instances and use osc to have them all talk to each other.




#### Video one
All of this off of accelerometer data?




### Bill's Talk
#### Presentation Style
Iannis Xenakis - look this dude up

start with conceptual map of the talk
50/50 male female split
he loooves blooms taxonomy

He also loves to just go into his body of work.
It's always very cerebral.

I think the "randomness" of the sound requires a lot of conceptual mapping.

Braggadocios
I think the vid of either just the practice or just the performance would have been enough
"I'm just going to show a portion" -> ends up showing most of it lmao.



#### Notes for myself
Communicate more you dumbass. You could have saved a lot of money and gave Bill a heads up that you wouldnt be there yesterday.
